WORM displayed in curses

This program creates a bootleg snake game. It takes 2 integers in the command
    line when it's executed. The two integers dictate the amount of rows and
    columns on the playing field respectively. The worm dies if it runs into the wall,
    it's body, or it's head. You win by taking up almost* all the spaces on the
    screen. To grow you must eat the 'fruit' that spawns on the screen in an empty
    space, the fruit has a random value between 1-9 inclusive that will dictate how
    much you grow. Your score is based on how many total spaces you've grown and is
    displayed at the top right of the screen.
